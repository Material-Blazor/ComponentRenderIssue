ComponentRenderIssue

This code demonstrates 3 rendering issues:

1) A simple component in a dialog does not render its DatePicker & Select

2) DatePicker does not honor the Disabled flag

3) Select renders oddly. The first time the menu goes upwards and is narrow. The second invocation has the menu going downward. In neither case does the menu allow for all items to be shown even though there is plety of room.
